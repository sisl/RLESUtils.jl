"""
Depth-first traverse over a tree and writes to a JSON file.  Interaction is generic, based on callbacks.
name=get_name(node), iterable(edgename,childnode)=get_chidren(node),depth=get_depth(node).
Usage:
Populate the callbacks into VisCalls and pass root node into write_json (output to file) or
to_jdict (output to dict)

Like to_jdict except writes output to json file.

"""
Depth-first traverse over tree and output to json object.  Input the root node and the callbacks.
