"""
Pre-allocated random samples organized into channels.
Primary use case is to enable threaded random number generation to have the same
deterministic outcome as sequential version.  Each loop iteration draws numbers from 
its own channel, which allows random and out of order computations.
See runtests.jl for example usage.
