"""
Generic parameter study. Load a basconfig for the basic function 'f', and a config for the param study
varying parameters. f should take only keyword arguments. result_type is the type that returned by f.
and will be serialized/vectorized for logging to a DataFrame.
"""

using RLESUtils, ParamSweeps, Observers, Loggers, Vectorizer, FileUtils
using CPUTime

"""
Calls function 'f' resulting in type 'result_type' for each combination of the iterables in 'kwargs'.
The key/values in 'kwargs' become the keyword arguments to 'f'.  'baseconfig' provides the default keyword
arguments to 'f' (overwritten by those in 'kwargs')
