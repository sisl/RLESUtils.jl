Maintains a pre-allocated pool of objects.  You can check out objects
and return them to the pool.  
Primary use is to avoid repeated temporary vector allocations
Objects are not initialized or cleaned in any way.  It is the
responsibility of the user to sanitize the old objects.
Note: there is no way to return a single object, must check_in_all
