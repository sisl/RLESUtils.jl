"""
Spawn new julia sessions and execute code in parallel.  will only run up
to number of procs available and automatically spawn the next task.
Example usage:
addprocs(2)
src_array = JuliaSource[ JuliaSource("using MyModule1; myfunc1()"), 
JuliaSource("using MyModule2; myfunc2()")]
pmap(julia_process, src_array)
Note: To work properly, create a symlink to this module in your julia pkg folder
